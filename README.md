# Summer Intership 2023

This repository contains all the codes that were used to recreate the figures in [Chen & al](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098776). 
In Chen & al (2023), the region of interest is located over North Northeastern America. However, during my internship, the region of interest is the domain of the 6th version of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM6/GEM5).

## How to use
Import python libraries before using `.ipynb`and `.py` files : 
```
$ module load python3
$ source activate base_plus
```

### Jupyter Folder
`jupyter` folder contains all `.ipynb` codes. I mainly use them to 

1. Run quick codes (less than 5 minutes)
2. Create figures
3. Debug longer code

### Python Folder
`python` folder contains all `.py` executable files.
