# Summer Intership 2023

This repository contrains all the codes that were used to recreate the figures in [Chen & al](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098776). 

## How to use
(TODO)

All the codes here are in `.py`. 

## Folders

### Jupyter Folder
`jupyter` folder contains all `.ipynb` codes. I mainly use them to 

1. Test some code
2. Create figures

This folder  **does not** contain official codes ! I only use them to quickly test things and see the output quickly.
